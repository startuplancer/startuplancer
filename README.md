# Hi there, I'm Alex Petrova 👋

I'm a San Francisco-based generative AI enthusiast, passionate about exploring the intersection of art and technology.

- 🔭 Currently experimenting with different generative AI techniques to create unique art pieces.
- 🌱 Learning more about neural networks and machine learning algorithms to improve my understanding of generative AI.
- 👯 Open to collaborating on interesting generative AI projects.
- 💬 Ask me about generative AI and its applications in art and creativity.
- 📫 Reach me at startuplancer@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not experimenting with generative AI, you can usually find me playing my guitar or exploring new hiking trails around San Francisco. I'm always up for a jam session or a scenic hike – let me know if you want to join me! 🎸🌄

Let's create something unique together! 🎨🤖
